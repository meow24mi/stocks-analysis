# Stock Analysis 

## Overview and Prpose of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to have access to quickly see the daily trading volume, and the annual return of each ticker. It will determining which stocks performed better or worse than DQ and guide decision for future investment. In anticipation of future needs, the code is updated to accodomate a larger volume of data with more effeciency.

## Analysis

As demonstrated in 2017 https://github.com/meow24mi/stocks-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2017.png.png was a very profitable year for the stocks in our analysis. The return that is positive is in green. With the exception of Ticker TERP, all stocks saw a positive return, with Ticker DQ having the greatest return at nearly 200%. In contrast in 2018 https://github.com/meow24mi/stocks-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2018.png.png most stocks saw a loss with the exception of Ticker ENPH and Ticker RUN. 

## Original Code Versus Refractored Code
Prior to refractoring the code, the run time for analysing 12 tickers in 2017 was completed in 0.79 seconds and the run time for analysing the same data in 2018 was 0.80 seconds. Although it does not appear to be very long period of time, multiply that by 100x or 1000x, it may not appear to be well executed. Post refractoring the code, the same data was analyzed in 0.15 seconds for stocks in 2017 and 2018. https://github.com/meow24mi/stocks-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2017.png.png https://github.com/meow24mi/stocks-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2018.png.png The difference will be perceivable as the volume of data increases. 


## Summary
Refractoring code enhances the user experience and elevates the level of service you provide to your clients. It is similar to plating an entree at an upscale restaurant; it has the garnish, the plate is warm, and it is nicely presented. It doesn't enahnce the nutritional value, or the calories ingested, and doesn't changethe basic goal of the meal, to nourish the body. However, the experience for the diner, and in our case the client, can be dramatically improved. As a result make our experience more positive. 

Similarly, refractored code is easy to follow, the logic flows better, and it uses less if-then statments. It's a win-win.
